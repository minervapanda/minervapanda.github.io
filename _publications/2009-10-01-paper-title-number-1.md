excerpt: 'A contextual care protocol is used by a medical
practitioner for patient healthcare, given the context or situation
that the specified patient is in. This paper proposes a method to
build an automated self-adapting protocol which can help make
relevant, early decisions for effective healthcare delivery. The
hybrid model leverages neural networks and decision trees. The
neural network estimates the chances of each disease and each
tree in the decision trees represents care protocol for a disease.
These trees are subject to change in case of aberrations found
by the diagnosticians. These corrections or prediction errors
are clustered into similar groups for scalability and review by
the experts. The corrections as suggested by the experts are
incorporated into the model.'
